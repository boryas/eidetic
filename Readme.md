# Eidetic, a simple framework for Getting Things Done

## Purpose
Eidetic remembers everything you tell it about your life's projects
so that you can focus on completing them.

## What does it do though?
Eidetic can remember a project for you, recall a project it has remembered
and forget a project you aren't working on anymore.
