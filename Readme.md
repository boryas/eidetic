# Eidetic, a simple framework for Getting Things Done

## Purpose
Eidetic remembers everything you tell it about your life's projects
so that you can focus on completing them.

## What does it do though?
Eidetic is a dead simple frontend to a db of tags. It provides a set of
interactive CLI tools to store, edit, and dump everything it knows about your
productive life.
